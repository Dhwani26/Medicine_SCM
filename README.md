KJHackathon: Supply Chain Management for medicine processing.

Imagine the medicine that has reached after a lot of processing and consumption of resources has reached its expiration date. Not just the medicine, it would be the batch of medicines. All the cost involved in between has been wasted. The most important of all, what if that is consumed just because of someone’s carelessness! What if the intake of medicine is different and the reason is completely different, that’s a life taking scenario. Who is responsible for all this? 
The manufacturer who did a careless mistake in production? The warehouse owner who delayed the process? The wholesaler who allowed the wrong to happen? Or the chemist who still has that faulty medicine?


With a theme of Blockchain and health what came to our mind was developing a medicine supply chain management trying to cover all the above problems. How awesome it would be to track your own medicine. To know the quality and status of your medicine at every step. To know how much time each stage took in medicine transport. 

We are implementing a medicine supply chain using blockchain concept.
